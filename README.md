Purpose: This repository is for practicing implementing fundamental statistical concepts in Python.

1. Descriptive Statistics - Penguins Analysis
-- With the Penguins Analysis file, I utilize Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. I read in a pre-loaded Seaborn dataset regarding Penguins and then calculate measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion
   using built-in functions in Pandas and Numpy. I then use Seaborn and Matplotlib to later visualize the distribution and boxplots of all numeric variables.
