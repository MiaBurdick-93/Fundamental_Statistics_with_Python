Purpose: This repository is for practicing implementing fundamental statistical concepts in Python.

1. Descriptive Statistics - Penguins Analysis
-- With the Penguins Analysis file, I utilize Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. I read in a pre-loaded Seaborn dataset regarding Penguins and then calculate measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion
   using built-in functions in Pandas and Numpy. I then use Seaborn and Matplotlib to later visualize the distribution and boxplots of all numeric variables.

2. Probability Foundations - Common Distributions
-- WIth the Common Distributions file, I practice visualizing common probability distributions for discrete and continuous variables.
   I include real-world examples where these distributions are applied and show the probabillity mass function for discrete variables and
   the probability density function for continuous variables as well as the cumulative distribution function.
